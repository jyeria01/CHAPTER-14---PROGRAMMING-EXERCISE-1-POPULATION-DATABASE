    "# Make sure you have downloaded the book’s source code from the companion website at www.pearson.com/gaddis. In this chapter’s source code folder, you will find a program named create_cities_db.py. Run the program. The program will create a database named cities.db. The  database will have a table named Cities , with the following columns:\n",
    "# CityID - INTERGER PRIMARY KEY\n",
    "# CityName - TEXT\n",
    "# Population - REAL\n",
    "# The CityName column stores the name of a city and the Population column stores the population of that city. After you run the create_cities_db.py  program, the Cities table will contain 20 rows with various cities and their populations.Next, write a program that connects to the cities.db database, and allows the user to select any of the following operations:\n",
